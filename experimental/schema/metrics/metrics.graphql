#  Each distinct type of DataPoint represents the output of a specific
#  aggregation function, the result of applying the DataPoint's
#  associated function of to one or more measurements.
# 
#  All DataPoint types have three common fields:
#  - Attributes includes key-value pairs associated with the data point
#  - TimeUnixNano is required, set to the end time of the aggregation
#  - StartTimeUnixNano is optional, but strongly encouraged for DataPoints having an AggregationTemporality field, as discussed below.

    # DELTA is an AggregationTemporality for a metric aggregator which reports

    # The values for a DELTA metric are based only on the time interval
    # associated with one measurement cycle. There is no dependency on
    # previous measurements like is the case for CUMULATIVE metrics.
    # For example, consider a system measuring the number of requests that
    # it receives and reports the sum of these requests every second as a
    # DELTA metric:
    #   1. The system starts receiving at time=t_0.

    # CUMULATIVE is an AggregationTemporality for a metric aggregator which
    # reports changes since a fixed start time. This means that current values
    # of a CUMULATIVE metric depend on all previous measurements since the
    # start time. Because of this, the sender is required to retain this state
    # in some form. If this state is lost or invalidated, the CUMULATIVE metric
    # values MUST be reset and a new fixed start time following the last
    # reported measurement time sent MUST be used.
    # For example, consider a system measuring the number of requests that
    # it receives and reports the sum of these requests every second as a
    # CUMULATIVE metric:
    #   1. The system starts receiving at time=t_0.
    #   2. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
    #   3. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
    #   4. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
    #   5. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
    #      number of requests received over the interval of time t_0 to
    #      t_0+1 with a value of 3.
    #   6. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
    #   7. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
    #   8. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
    #      number of requests received over the interval of time t_0 to
    #      t_0+2 with a value of 5.
    #   9. The system experiences a fault and loses state.
    #   10. The system recovers and resumes receiving at time=t_1.
    #   11. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
    #   12. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
    #      number of requests received over the interval of time t_1 to
    #      t_0+1 with a value of 1.
    # Note: Even though, when reporting changes since last report time, using
    # CUMULATIVE is valid, it is not recommended. This may cause problems for
    # systems that do not use start_time to determine when the aggregation
    # value was reset (e.g. Prometheus).
