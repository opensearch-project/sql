# OpenSearch SQL

OpenSearch enables you to extract insights out of OpenSearch using the familiar SQL or Piped Processing Language (PPL) query syntax. Use aggregations, group by, and where clauses to investigate your data. Read your data as JSON documents or CSV tables so you have the flexibility to use the format that works best for you.

The following projects have been merged into this repository as separate folders as of July 9, 2020. Please refer to links below for details. This document will focus on the SQL plugin for OpenSearch.

* [SQL CLI](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/tree/main/sql-cli)
* [SQL JDBC](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/tree/main/sql-jdbc)
* [SQL ODBC](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/tree/main/sql-odbc)
* [Query Workbench](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/tree/main/workbench)


## Highlights

Besides basic filtering and aggregation, OpenSearch SQL also supports complex queries, such as querying semi-structured data, JOINs, set operations, sub-queries etc. Beyond the standard functions, OpenSearch functions are provided for better analytics and visualization. Please check our [documentation](#documentation) for more details.

Recently we have been actively improving our query engine primarily for better correctness and extensibility. Behind the scene, the new enhanced engine has already supported both SQL and Piped Processing Language. Please find more details in [SQL Engine V2 - Release Notes](/docs/dev/NewSQLEngine.md).


## Documentation

Please refer to the [SQL Language Reference Manual](./docs/user/index.rst), [Piped Processing Language (PPL) Reference Manual](./docs/user/ppl/index.rst) and [Technical Documentation](https://docs-beta.opensearch.org/) for detailed information on installing and configuring plugin.
