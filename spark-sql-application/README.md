# Spark SQL Application

This application execute sql query and store the result in OpenSearch index in following format
```
"stepId":"<emr-step-id>",
"schema": "json blob",
"result": "json blob"
```

## Prerequisites

+ Spark 3.3.1
+ Scala 2.12.15
+ flint-spark-integration

## Usage

To use this application, you can run Spark with Flint extension:

```
./bin/spark-submit \
    --class org.opensearch.sql.SQLJob \
    --jars <flint-spark-integration-jar> \
    sql-job.jar \
    <spark-sql-query> \
    <opensearch-index> \
    <opensearch-host> \
    <opensearch-port> \
    <opensearch-scheme> \
    <opensearch-auth> \
    <opensearch-region> \
```

## Result Specifications

Following example shows how the result is written to OpenSearch index after query execution.

Let's assume sql query result is
```
+------+------+
|Letter|Number|
+------+------+
|A     |1     |
|B     |2     |
|C     |3     |
+------+------+
```
OpenSearch index document will look like
```json
{
  "_index" : ".query_execution_result",
  "_id" : "A2WOsYgBMUoqCqlDJHrn",
  "_score" : 1.0,
  "_source" : {
    "result" : [
    "{'Letter':'A','Number':1}",
    "{'Letter':'B','Number':2}",
    "{'Letter':'C','Number':3}"
    ],
    "schema" : [
      "{'column_name':'Letter','data_type':'string'}",
      "{'column_name':'Number','data_type':'integer'}"
    ],
    "stepId" : "s-JZSB1139WIVU"
  }
}
```
