Description
===========

The ``chart`` command transforms search results by applying a statistical aggregation function and optionally grouping the data by one or two fields. The results are suitable for visualization as a two-dimension chart when grouping by two fields, where unique values in the second group key can be pivoted to column names.

Syntax
======
chart [limit=(top|bottom) <number>] [useother=<boolean>] [usenull=<boolean>] [nullstr=<string>] [otherstr=<string>] <aggregation_function> [ by <row_split> <column_split> ] | [over <row_split> ] [ by <column_split>]

* limit: optional. Specifies the number of categories to display when using column split. Each unique value in the column split field represents a category. **Default:** top10
    - Syntax: ``limit=(top|bottom)<number>`` or ``limit=<number>`` (defaults to top)
    - When ``limit=K`` is set, the top or bottom K categories from the column split field are retained; the remaining categories are grouped into an "OTHER" category if ``useother`` is not set to false.
    - Set limit to 0 to show all categories without any limit.
    - Use ``limit=topK`` or ``limit=bottomK`` to specify whether to retain the top or bottom K column categories. The ranking is based on the sum of aggregated values for each column category. For example, ``chart limit=top3 count() by region, product`` keeps the 3 products with the highest total counts across all regions. If not specified, top is used by default.
    - Only applies when column split is present (by 2 fields or over...by... coexists).
* useother: optional. Controls whether to create an "OTHER" category for categories beyond the limit. **Default:** true
    - When set to false, only the top/bottom N categories (based on limit) are shown without an "OTHER" category.
    - When set to true, categories beyond the limit are grouped into an "OTHER" category.
    - Only applies when using column split and when there are more categories than the limit.
* usenull: optional. Controls whether to group events without a column split (i.e. whose column split is null) into a separate "NULL" category. **Default:** true
    - ``usenull`` only applies to column split.
    - Row split should always be non-null value. Documents with null values in row split will be ignored.
    - When ``usenull=false``, events with a null column split are excluded from results.
    - When ``usenull=true``, events with a null column split are grouped into a separate "NULL" category.
* nullstr: optional. Specifies the category name for rows that do not contain the column split value. **Default:** "NULL"
    - Only applies when ``usenull`` is set to true.
* otherstr: optional. Specifies the category name for the "OTHER" category. **Default:** "OTHER"
    - Only applies when ``useother`` is set to true and there are values beyond the limit.
* aggregation_function: mandatory. The aggregation function to apply to the data.
    - Currently, only a single aggregation function is supported.
    - Available functions: aggregation functions supported by the stats command.
* by: optional. Groups the results by either one field (row split) or two fields (row split and column split)
    - ``limit``, ``useother``, and ``usenull`` apply to the column split
    - Results are returned as individual rows for each combination.
    - If not specified, the aggregation is performed across all documents.
* over...by...: optional. Alternative syntax for grouping by multiple fields.
    - ``over <row_split> by <column_split>`` groups the results by both fields.
    - Using ``over`` alone on one field is equivalent to ``by <row-split>``

Notes
=====

* The fields generated by column splitting are converted to strings so that they are compatible with ``nullstr`` and ``otherstr`` and can be used as column names once pivoted.
* Documents with null values in fields used by the aggregation function are excluded from aggregation. For example, in ``chart avg(balance) over deptno, group``, documents where ``balance`` is null are excluded from the average calculation.
* The aggregation metric appears as the last column in the result. Result columns are ordered as: [row-split] [column-split] [aggregation-metrics].

Example 1: Basic aggregation without grouping
=============================================

This example calculates the average balance across all accounts.

PPL query::

    os> source=accounts | chart avg(balance)
    fetched rows / total rows = 1/1
    +--------------+
    | avg(balance) |
    |--------------|
    | 20482.25     |
    +--------------+

Example 2: Group by single field
================================

This example calculates the count of accounts grouped by gender.

PPL query::

    os> source=accounts | chart count() by gender
    fetched rows / total rows = 2/2
    +--------+---------+
    | gender | count() |
    |--------+---------|
    | F      | 1       |
    | M      | 3       |
    +--------+---------+

Example 3: Using over and by for multiple field grouping
========================================================

This example shows average balance grouped by both gender and age fields. Note that the age column in the result is converted to string type.

PPL query::

    os> source=accounts | chart avg(balance) over gender by age
    fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
    +--------+-----+--------------+
    | gender | age | avg(balance) |
    |--------+-----+--------------|
    | F      | 28  | 32838.0      |
    | M      | 32  | 39225.0      |
    | M      | 33  | 4180.0       |
    | M      | 36  | 5686.0       |
    +--------+-----+--------------+

Example 4: Using basic limit functionality
==========================================

This example limits the results to show only the top 1 age group. Note that the age column in the result is converted to string type.

PPL query::

    os> source=accounts | chart limit=1 count() over gender by age
    fetched rows / total rows = 3/3
    +--------+-------+---------+
    | gender | age   | count() |
    |--------+-------+---------|
    | F      | OTHER | 1       |
    | M      | 33    | 1       |
    | M      | OTHER | 2       |
    +--------+-------+---------+

Example 5: Using limit with other parameters
============================================

This example shows using limit with useother and custom otherstr parameters.

PPL query::

    os> source=accounts | chart limit=top1 useother=true otherstr='minor_gender' count() over state by gender
    fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
    +-------+--------------+---------+
    | state | gender       | count() |
    |-------+--------------+---------|
    | IL    | M            | 1       |
    | MD    | M            | 1       |
    | TN    | M            | 1       |
    | VA    | minor_gender | 1       |
    +-------+--------------+---------+

Example 6: Using null parameters
================================

This example shows using limit with usenull and custom nullstr parameters.

PPL query::

    os> source=accounts |  chart usenull=true nullstr='employer not specified' count() over firstname by employer
    fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
    +-----------+------------------------+---------+
    | firstname | employer               | count() |
    |-----------+------------------------+---------|
    | Amber     | Pyrami                 | 1       |
    | Dale      | employer not specified | 1       |
    | Hattie    | Netagy                 | 1       |
    | Nanette   | Quility                | 1       |
    +-----------+------------------------+---------+

Example 7: Using chart command with span
========================================

This example demonstrates using span for grouping age ranges.

PPL query::

    os> source=accounts | chart max(balance) by age span=10, gender
    fetched rows / total rows = 2/2
    +-----+--------+--------------+
    | age | gender | max(balance) |
    |-----+--------+--------------|
    | 20  | F      | 32838        |
    | 30  | M      | 39225        |
    +-----+--------+--------------+

Limitations
===========
* Only a single aggregation function is supported per chart command.
