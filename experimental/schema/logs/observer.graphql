#An observer is defined as a special network, security, or application device used to detect, observe, or create network, security, or application-related events and metrics.
#
#This could be a custom hardware appliance or a server that has been configured to run special network, security, or application software. Examples include firewalls, web proxies, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network monitoring sensors, web application firewalls, data loss prevention systems, and APM servers.
# The observer.* fields shall be populated with details of the system, if any, that detects, observes and/or creates a network, security, or application event or metric. Message queues and ETL components used in processing events or metrics are not considered observers

    #'Date/time when the event originated.
    #
    #        This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
    #        the event was generated by the source.
    #
    #        If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
    #        by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
