# Commands  

PPL supports most common [SQL functions](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/search-plugins/sql/functions/), including [relevance search](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/search-plugins/sql/full-text/), but also introduces several more functions, called _commands_, which are available in PPL only.
