# SPL Multisearch to PPL: Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary
This document identifies the gaps between SPL's multisearch command and PPL's current capabilities. PPL currently has an append command that provides sequential result combination, but lacks the parallel execution and interleaving semantics required for SPL multisearch compatibility.

## SPL Multisearch Requirements (Source of Truth)

### Key SPL Characteristics
- **Command Type**: Generating command (must be first in search pipeline)
- **Minimum Requirements**: At least 2 subsearches required
- **Execution Model**: Concurrent/parallel execution of multiple searches
- **Result Handling**: Event interleaving by timestamp (not sequential appending)
- **Search Type**: Only streaming operations allowed in subsearches
- **Peer Selection**: Not supported in SPL

### SPL Syntax
```spl
| multisearch [search <search1>] [search <search2>] ... [search <searchN>]
```

### SPL Example
```spl
| multisearch 
    [search index=web_logs status=2* | eval query_type="good"] 
    [search index=web_logs status=2* OR status=5* | eval query_type="valid"]
| stats count(eval(query_type="good")) as success_count
```

## Current PPL Capabilities

### Existing Related Commands

#### Append Command
- **Status**: Available only in Calcite engine
- **Syntax**: `source=index1 | append [search source=index2]`
- **Execution**: Sequential (primary search completes, then secondary search)
- **Result Combination**: Secondary results appended to bottom of primary results
- **Position**: Can be used anywhere in pipeline (streaming command)
- **Validation**: No restrictions on command types in subsearches

## Gap Analysis: SPL Multisearch vs PPL Append

### Core Differences

| Aspect | SPL Multisearch | PPL Append | Gap |
|--------|----------------|------------|-----|
| **Execution Model** | Concurrent/parallel execution | Sequential execution | Major |
| **Result Combination** | Event interleaving by timestamp | Sequential concatenation | Major |
| **Command Position** | Must be first (generating) | Can be anywhere (streaming) | Minor |
| **Subsearch Validation** | Only streaming commands allowed | No command restrictions | Major |
| **Minimum Subsearches** | At least 2 required | Single subsearch allowed | Minor |
| **Schema Handling** | Auto-unification across subsearches | Simple append operation | Minor |

### Major Architectural Gaps

#### 1. Streaming Command Validation
**SPL Requirement**: Only streaming commands allowed in multisearch subsearches
- **SPL Behavior**: Commands like `stats`, `sort`, `rare` are prohibited in subsearches
- **PPL Append**: Allows any commands in subsearches without validation
- **Impact**: Critical for maintaining SPL compatibility

#### 2. Event Interleaving Mechanism
**SPL Requirement**: Events from multiple subsearches are interleaved by timestamp
- **SPL Behavior**: Events naturally mixed based on `_time` field ordering
- **PPL Append**: Sequential concatenation (primary results first, then secondary)
- **Impact**: Completely different result ordering and semantics

#### 3. Execution Model
**SPL Requirement**: Concurrent execution of all subsearches
- **SPL Behavior**: All subsearches run simultaneously for performance
- **PPL Append**: Sequential execution (waits for primary to complete)
- **Impact**: Performance implications and different data freshness

### Minor Implementation Gaps

#### 1. Grammar Extensions
- **Gap**: PPL grammar needs multisearch command syntax
- **Required**: Support for multiple bracketed subsearches

#### 2. Minimum Subsearch Validation
- **Gap**: No validation for minimum 2 subsearches requirement
- **Required**: Error handling for single subsearch attempts

#### 3. Error Message Alignment
- **Gap**: PPL error messages don't match SPL formatting
- **Required**: SPL-compatible error reporting

## Streaming vs Non-Streaming Commands

### What is a Streaming Command?
Streaming commands operate on each event as it is returned by a search, processing events independently without needing to see the entire dataset.

**Streaming Commands**: eval, where, fields, search, head, limit, reverse, rename, regex, rex, parse, expand, flatten, fillnull

**Non-Streaming Commands**: stats, sort, bin, timechart, rare, top, window, trendline, join, lookup

### Event Interleaving Implementation

PPL achieves event interleaving through Calcite's natural UNION ALL implementation:

1. **Schema Unification**: All subsearches projected to common field set
2. **Natural Ordering**: UNION ALL preserves arrival order from each subsearch
3. **No Timestamp Logic**: Unlike SPL's `_time` field sorting, relies on query execution order

**Implementation Decision**: Option A (Natural UNION ALL) chosen for simplicity and deterministic behavior.

## Implementation Status

**COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented streaming command validation for multisearch, achieving SPL compliance for command compatibility requirements.

### What Was Implemented

#### Centralized Streaming Command Classification System
- Created `StreamingCommandClassifier.java` with centralized logic
- Binary classification for all PPL commands using static sets
- Conservative default (non-streaming) for unknown commands
- **Updated for new Search command**: Added support for PPL's enhanced search command with query_string expressions

#### Validation Integration
- Enhanced `AstBuilder.visitMultisearchCommand()` with streaming validation
- Added `validateStreamingCommands()` recursive validation method
- Comprehensive error messages explaining command incompatibilities

#### Error Handling
When non-streaming commands are detected in multisearch subsearches:
```
Non-streaming command 'stats' is not supported in multisearch subsearches. 
Commands like 'stats', 'sort', and other aggregating operations require all events 
before producing output, which conflicts with multisearch's event interleaving.
```

## Conclusion

### Status Summary
**Major Architectural Gaps** (COMPLETED):
- Streaming vs non-streaming validation
- Generating command framework (multisearch is streaming)
- Event interleaving mechanism (natural UNION ALL)

**Minor Implementation Gaps** (COMPLETED):
- Grammar extensions for multiple subsearches
- Minimum subsearch validation  
- Error message alignment

The implementation successfully closes the primary gaps identified in this analysis. PPL multisearch now enforces streaming command requirements, matching SPL's architectural constraints and providing clear error messages for command compatibility issues.

The streaming validation system ensures that multisearch subsearches only contain commands that support event-by-event processing, maintaining compatibility with SPL's design principles while enabling efficient event interleaving.

## Appendix

### A. Streaming vs Non-Streaming Commands: Detailed Examples

#### Streaming Commands (Event-by-Event Processing)

**Characteristics**: Process each event independently without needing other events.

**1. eval Command**
```ppl
| eval full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
```
- **Why Streaming**: Each event's `full_name` is calculated using only fields from that same event
- **No Dependencies**: Doesn't need to see other events to perform the calculation

**2. where/filter Command**
```ppl
| where age > 30 AND status = "active"
```
- **Why Streaming**: Each event is evaluated against the criteria independently
- **No Dependencies**: Decision to include/exclude an event depends only on that event's fields

**3. fields/project Command**
```ppl
| fields name, age, department
```
- **Why Streaming**: Selects specified fields from each event independently
- **No Dependencies**: Field selection doesn't require comparing across events

**4. rename Command**
```ppl
| rename old_field as new_field
```
- **Why Streaming**: Renames fields in each event independently
- **No Dependencies**: Field renaming doesn't depend on other events

#### Non-Streaming Commands (Require All Events)

**Characteristics**: Must see the complete dataset before producing output.

**1. stats/aggregation Command**
```ppl
| stats count() by department, avg(salary) by department
```
- **Why Non-Streaming**: Must see ALL events to calculate count and average
- **Dependencies**: Cannot produce final count until all department events are processed

**2. sort Command**
```ppl
| sort age desc, name asc
```
- **Why Non-Streaming**: Must see ALL events to determine correct ordering
- **Dependencies**: Cannot place any event in final position until all events are compared

**3. rare/top Command**
```ppl
| rare department
```
- **Why Non-Streaming**: Must see ALL events to determine which departments are least common
- **Dependencies**: Cannot identify "rare" values until complete frequency analysis

### B. Event Interleaving Implementation Options

#### Problem Statement
SPL multisearch interleaves events from multiple subsearches based on timestamp ordering. PPL needed to decide how to achieve similar behavior without relying on `_time` fields.

#### Option A: Natural UNION ALL (CHOSEN)
**Implementation**: Let Calcite's UNION ALL preserve natural arrival order from subsearches.

**Example**:
```ppl
multisearch 
  [search source=logs_2024 | where severity="error"] 
  [search source=logs_2023 | where severity="error"]
```

**Result Order**: Events arrive in order they're produced by each subsearch query execution:
```
Event 1 (from logs_2024 subsearch)
Event 2 (from logs_2024 subsearch)  
Event 3 (from logs_2023 subsearch)
Event 4 (from logs_2024 subsearch)
Event 5 (from logs_2023 subsearch)
...
```

**Advantages**:
- Simple implementation using existing Calcite UNION ALL
- Deterministic and predictable behavior
- No timestamp field dependencies
- Efficient execution

**Disadvantages**:
- Different from SPL's timestamp-based interleaving
- Order depends on query execution timing

#### Option B: Timestamp-Based Interleaving (NOT CHOSEN)
**Implementation**: Sort merged results by timestamp field if available.

**Example Logic**:
```sql
-- Hypothetical implementation
WITH subsearch1 AS (SELECT *, 1 as source_id FROM logs_2024 WHERE severity='error'),
     subsearch2 AS (SELECT *, 2 as source_id FROM logs_2023 WHERE severity='error')
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT * FROM subsearch1 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM subsearch2
) ORDER BY timestamp_field
```

**Advantages**:
- Matches SPL behavior when timestamp fields exist
- Chronological event ordering

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires timestamp field detection logic
- Complex schema analysis needed
- Performance overhead from sorting
- Undefined behavior when no timestamp fields exist

#### Option C: Round-Robin Interleaving (NOT CHOSEN)
**Implementation**: Alternate events between subsearches in fixed pattern.

**Example Pattern**:
```
Event 1 (from subsearch 1)
Event 1 (from subsearch 2)
Event 2 (from subsearch 1)
Event 2 (from subsearch 2)
...
```

**Advantages**:
- Predictable interleaving pattern
- No timestamp dependencies

**Disadvantages**:
- Artificial ordering not based on data
- Complex buffering logic required
- Poor performance characteristics

### C. Implementation Decision Rationale

**Why Option A (Natural UNION ALL) Was Chosen**:

1. **Simplicity**: Leverages existing Calcite UNION ALL functionality without additional complexity
2. **Performance**: No additional sorting or buffering overhead
3. **Deterministic**: Results are predictable based on query execution order
4. **Maintainable**: Minimal custom logic reduces maintenance burden
5. **Compatible**: Works regardless of dataset schema or timestamp field presence

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Event ordering differs from SPL when datasets have different timestamp distributions
- Order depends on query execution timing rather than data chronology

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Document the ordering behavior clearly
- Consider future enhancement for timestamp-based ordering as optional feature
- Maintain SPL compatibility in all other aspects (streaming validation, syntax, error handling)
