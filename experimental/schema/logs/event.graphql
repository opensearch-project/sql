    #          more general event definition of something that happened.

#This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.

    #    The start event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate something has started. A common example is event.category:process AND event.type:start.

    #  The end event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate something has ended. A common example is event.category:process AND event.type:end.
    end
    #The info event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate that they are purely informational, and don’t report a state change, or any type of action. For example, an initial run of a file integrity monitoring system (FIM), where an agent reports all files under management, would fall into the "info" subcategory. Similarly, an event containing a dump of all currently running processes (as opposed to reporting that a process started/ended) would fall into the "info" subcategory. An additional common examples is event.category:intrusion_detection AND event.type:info.
    info
    #    The error event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate or describe an error. A common example is event.category:database AND event.type:error. Note that pipeline errors that occur during the event ingestion process should not use this event.type value. Instead, they should use event.kind:pipeline_error.
    error
    #The admin event type is used for the subset of events within a category that are related to admin objects. For example, administrative changes within an IAM framework that do not specifically affect a user or group (e.g., adding new applications to a federation solution or connecting discrete forests in Active Directory) would fall into this subcategory. Common example: event.category:iam AND event.type:change AND event.type:admin. You can further distinguish admin operations using the ECS event.action field
    admin
    # The access event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate that something was accessed. Common examples include event.category:database AND event.type:access, or event.category:file AND event.type:access. Note for file access, both directory listings and file opens should be included in this subcategory. You can further distinguish access operations using the ECS event.action field
    access
    #The change event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate that something has changed. If semantics best describe an event as modified, then include them in this subcategory. Common examples include event.category:process AND event.type:change, and event.category:file AND event.type:change. You can further distinguish change operations using the ECS event.action field.

    #The group event type is used for the subset of events within a category that are related to group objects. Common example: event.category:iam AND event.type:creation AND event.type:group. You can further distinguish group operations using the ECS event.action field.
    group

    # The allowed event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate that something was allowed. Common examples include event.category:network AND event.type:connection AND event.type:allowed (to indicate a network firewall event for which the firewall disposition was to allow the connection to complete) and event.category:intrusion_detection AND event.type:allowed (to indicate a network intrusion prevention system event for which the IPS disposition was to allow the connection to complete). You can further distinguish allowed operations using the ECS event.action field, populating with values of your choosing, such as "allow", "detect", or "pass"
    allowed
    #  The denied event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate that something was denied. Common examples include event.category:network AND event.type:denied (to indicate a network firewall event for which the firewall disposition was to deny the connection) and event.category:intrusion_detection AND event.type:denied (to indicate a network intrusion prevention system event for which the IPS disposition was to deny the connection to complete). You can further distinguish denied operations using the ECS event.action field, populating with values of your choosing, such as "blocked", "dropped", or "quarantined".
    denied
    # Used primarily with event.category:network this value is used for the subset of network traffic that includes sufficient information for the event to be included in flow or connection analysis. Events in this subcategory will contain at least source and destination IP addresses, source and destination TCP/UDP ports, and will usually contain counts of bytes and/or packets transferred. Events in this subcategory may contain unidirectional or bidirectional information, including summary information. Use this subcategory to visualize and analyze network connections. Flow analysis, including Netflow, IPFIX, and other flow-related events fit in this subcategory. Note that firewall events from many Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) devices will also fit into this subcategory. A common filter for flow/connection information would be event.category:network AND event.type:connection AND event.type:end (to view or analyze all completed network connections, ignoring mid-flow reports). You can further distinguish connection events using the ECS event.action field, populating with values of your choosing, such as "timeout", or "reset".
    connection
    #    The protocol event type is used for the subset of events within a category that indicate that they contain protocol details or analysis, beyond simply identifying the protocol. Generally, network events that contain specific protocol details will fall into this subcategory. A common example is event.category:network AND event.type:protocol AND event.type:connection AND event.type:end (to indicate that the event is a network connection event sent at the end of a connection that also includes a protocol detail breakdown). Note that events that only indicate the name or id of the protocol should not use the protocol value. Further note that when the protocol subcategory is used, the identified protocol is populated in the ECS network.protocol field.

    #        If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access
    #        log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes
    #        from.
    #
    #        It''s recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module

    #        This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event.
    #        Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes
    #        why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action`

    #
    #        The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity`
